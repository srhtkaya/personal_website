{"name":"Serhat Kaya","tagline":"What a computational physicist can do?","body":"### Welcome to my personal page\r\nIf you are reading this post now, you probably want to have more information about me. It is simple, just move on next section.\r\n\r\n### Who am I?\r\nI am currently a senior physics student at Boğaziçi University, Turkey. It may seem that my all interests are about physics, but I can assure you they are not. I am a computer programmer, software developer, web designer, author (yes, definitely I am), movie lover.\r\n\r\n### What makes me different?\r\nIndeed, nothing. Since I was a child, I always tried to act like a normal person.\r\n\r\n### What am I capable of?\r\nI said I was a developer. As a physicist, I used C, python, and Java. And I also have experience in HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Photoshop, Corel Draw, Adobe Flash, database with SQL, XML, JSON, and so on. \r\n\r\nBesides these, I am interested designing. By saying designing, I mean any kind of design from web to furniture.\r\n\r\n===","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
