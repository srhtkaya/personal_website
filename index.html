<p>If you are reading this post now, you probably want to have more information about me. It is simple, just move on next section.</p>

<a name="who-am-i" class="anchor" href="#who-am-i"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who am I?</h3>

<p>I am currently a senior physics student at Boğaziçi University, Turkey. It may seem that my all interests are about physics, but I can assure you they are not. I am a computer programmer, software developer, web designer, author (yes, definitely I am), movie lover.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-makes-me-different" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-me-different"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What makes me different?</h3>

<p>Indeed, nothing. Since I was a child, I always tried to act like a normal person.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-am-i-capable-of" class="anchor" href="#what-am-i-capable-of"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What am I capable of?</h3>

<p>I said I was a developer. As a physicist, I used C, python, and Java. And I also have experience in HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Photoshop, Corel Draw, Adobe Flash, database with SQL, XML, JSON, and so on. </p>

<p>Besides these, I am interested designing. By saying designing, I mean any kind of design from web to furniture.</p>
